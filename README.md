# AI Interview Bot Backend

An intelligent interview assistant that helps companies conduct consistent, unbiased, and efficient technical interviews. Powered by Google's Gemini Pro AI model, this system provides a structured interview experience while saving time and resources.

## ðŸ›  Technical Implementation

### Architecture Overview
The project follows a modern client-server architecture:
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite
- Backend: FastAPI + Python
- AI: Google's Gemini Pro LLM

### Key Components

#### 1. Interview Bot Core (Python)
- Implemented a stateful interview system using `InterviewBot` class
- Manages 5 distinct interview stages (introduction â†’ technical â†’ experience â†’ behavioral â†’ closing)
- Uses LangChain for structured interaction with Gemini Pro
- Implements dynamic stage transitions based on response analysis
- Maintains conversation context and scoring history

#### 2. Intelligent Question Generation
- Stage-specific prompt templates for contextual questions
- Dynamic question adaptation based on:
  - Candidate's resume content
  - Previous responses
  - Current interview stage
  - Technical depth shown by candidate

#### 3. Response Evaluation System
- Multi-dimensional scoring system:
  - Relevance (0-10)
  - Depth (0-10)
  - Clarity (0-10)
  - Technical Accuracy (0-10)
- Stage-specific weighted scoring
- Automated feedback generation
- Comprehensive interview summary generation

#### 4. Frontend Implementation
- Real-time interview interface with Material-UI
- Speech recognition for voice responses
- Text-to-speech for interviewer questions
- Dynamic progress tracking
- Detailed score visualization
- Responsive design for optimal user experience
